          I am <strong>Varun Taneja</strong>, a Senior at the <strong>University of Notre Dame</strong> majoring in 
          <strong> Computer Engineering</strong> with a concentration in <strong>cybersecurity</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My diverse background, growing up in Singapore, has equipped me with the valuable skill of bridging cultural divides 
          and connecting with individuals from various backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Notre Dame, I am an active member of the club golf team, where I play competitive golf and proudly represent our university 
          at both regional and national levels. Golf has instilled in me the ability to confront and overcome adversity, teaching me to 
          persevere through mentally challenging situations â€“ a skill I consider invaluable in fast-paced environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          My two years of mandatory conscription in Singapore&apos;s armed forces further honed my teamwork and discipline, attributes I carried with 
          me when I joined the club boxing team at Notre Dame. These qualities, along with my technical knowledge in software engineering, gained 
          through coursework and hands-on experience at <strong>Vena Energy</strong> in <strong>Cloud Computing</strong>, <strong>Data Engineering</strong> at <strong>Partior</strong>
          , and <strong>AI research</strong> at <strong>Notre Dame</strong>, are integral to my professional development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I expect to graduate in May 2025, and I am currently interested in full-time positions. I am excited to contribute my unique background, 
          technical expertise, and dedication to teamwork and discipline to your company&apos;s team.
